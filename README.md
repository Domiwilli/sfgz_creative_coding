# sfgz_creative_coding

This is a creative coding project on the subject of weather.
The repository was buildt during a course of a Interaction Design HF course.
It includes my first experiences with p5.js

The windmills simulate de intensity of wind in different cities all over the world.
For example you can type Barcelona and push the button «submit», so it will show you
the wind intensity of Barcelona.
Or you can manually move the four regulators (windstaerke, temperatur, windrichtung und
luftfeuchtigkeit) back and forth, for different impressions.
